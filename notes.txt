Introduction To Quantum Computing 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
information and algorithms
computers carry out instructions on some info to give new info

algorithms, classed by how they grow with size of input

exponential time, running time grows exponentially with length
of the input

integer factorisation

2 factors that limit size of problems QC can solve:
data --> qubits, error rate --> delicate computers (noise)

estimate factoring of 617-digit RSA in under a day: 20 million
noisy qubits

//side , split the problem in 2

-----------------------------------------------------------------

simulating a quantum computer, possible up to 30 qubits

NOT gate: X-gate , .x
whether two bits are different or not: XOR gate
controlled by CNOT , .cx

Toffoli gate: AND gate, .ccx
